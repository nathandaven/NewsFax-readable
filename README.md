# NewsFax Readable

A modified version of the NewsFax theme, which is a modified version of the Promenade theme, inspired by Teletext and Ceefax services of yesteryear. It comes complete with Teletext style page numbers and R/G/B/Y options along the bottom of each article.

I liked this theme but jsut found the monospacing not great for actual article reading. Behold, this hacked monster.

Remote control not included.
